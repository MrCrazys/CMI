## How to contribute to mrdev/CMI

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**
Instead please contact us private to practice responsible disclosure.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mrfdev/CMI/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mrfdev/CMI/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and something demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write an FAQ or add-on you wish to share?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the contribution if possible.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes what the new content/contribution is about.

#### **Did you fix a spelling error, fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial we do kind of prefer you contact Floris manually, but you're still free to report it, either collect them together in a single new issue. Or fix them all at once as a contribution.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* Please contact Floris on the Zrips Discord. And let's have a conversation first.

The mrfdev is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and help us help the community.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:

Floris.
