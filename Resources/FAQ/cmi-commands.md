Both base commands and your own custom commands

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> CMI can handle Commands.

By default CMI has all it's commands underneath `/cmi <command>` you can find them all by typing: `/cmi help` and by viewing the list on the website here: (<https://www.zrips.net/cmi/commands/>)
If you wish to use `/<command>` and not just `/cmi <command>`, then you can edit the `/Settings/Alias.yml` file and change the `Enabled` option from false to true.
```yaml
  #  
  # /cmi home $1-
  /home:
    Enabled: true
    Tab: true
```
You can now save the file and type: `/cmi reload`, but to properly register the commands, you must /stop your server and start it again.


## Your own custom alias commands

Another option is to add your own commands. For example: `/banana`.
Custom Aliases (commands) are stored in the `~/plugins/CMI/CustomAlias/` folder, and by default, are stored in the `CustomAlias.yml` file. However, as of version 9.0.3.x and upwards, you can also store Custom Aliases in their own .yml file in the `~/plugins/CMI/CustomAlias/` directory.
To get started type `/cmi aliaseditor`. It will come up with an interface of all the registered custom aliases. Clicking on the green `+` will display a prompt in chat, asking you to enter the name of the command in the chat.
Once you have done this, it will open another interface which will also show a green `+`. Clicking on it will prompt you to enter the command that should be executed in the chat box, without the starting /. For example: `cmi say I am a banana.` 
You can press the green `+` again to add another command.
This feature is very dynamic, extensive and flexible. You can learn much more about it [here](https://www.zrips.net/cmi/commands/custom-alias/).

Your new command will show red, but it will still work. To properly register it, you must /stop your server and start it again. Once the server has restarted, the command will be properly registered and will auto-complete too. 
To edit existing custom aliases, you can type `/cmi aliaseditor` and then click on the command in the list. Optionally, you can type `/cmi aliaseditor <command>` to quickly navigate to a specific command. 

A visual YouTube tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN54XU12Zjc)

- And finally; `/stop` the server, and start it up again to guarantee that everything's working properly.
